# studio-ghibli-api

This was made for a friend who wanted to create a project centered around Studio Ghibli films, but noticed that there weren't a lot of Studio Ghibli APIs out there. This API was created with node.js, express.js and written with JavaScript. I've also used express-rate-limit to limit the amount of request that can be made. 10 requests/15mins. Credit to express-rate-limit. Please check them out here: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit">https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit</a>

This API includes the following about Studio Ghibli films:
<ul>
  <li>Poster/Image</li>
  <li>Genre</li>
  <li>Ratings</li>
  <li>Synopsis</li>
  <li>Director</li>
